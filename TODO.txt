- Fix HPBar: the labels are sometimes misaligned depending on the length
  of the pony's name

- Implement more animations and give animations to moves which haven't one
  yet

- Labels under the HPBar are often too small, so their text becomes '...'

- Teleport Blast bug? Sometimes allows infinite attacks

- Test in depth Relay Race

- Fix 'avoid' animations

- 'Repeat' bug: sometimes locks the wrong move / allows using blocking
  moves like Love Burst several times in a row

- Add drain animation to Wild Weed (also check for bugs when pony is fainted)

- Implement multiple (simultaneous or consecutive) animations -> Consecutive done

- forcedToSwitch should sometimes be set only on damage (immunity prevents it)

- SPEED UP THE GAME IF LAUNCHED FROM JAR! -> Partially fixed

- (Really) Implement Weather

- Sound control in the BattlePanel

- Moves which drop stats after usage should not drop them on 'immune' -> Done

- Implement 'export log' feature

- 'Fainted' messages should be sent only once by the server! -> Probably fixed

- Toxic activates even when the pony is already fainted -> Fixed

- Heavy Massage not removing statuses? -> Fixed

- Nicknames: config option to set default nicks, request nick on login feature 

- Whois shouldn't show the IP to clients other than admins -> atm doesn't send them to anyone
