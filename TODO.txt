=== TODO ===
- Fix HPBar: the labels are sometimes misaligned depending on the length
  of the pony's name

- Implement more animations and give animations to moves which haven't one
  yet

- Labels under the HPBar are often too small, so their text becomes '...'

- Teleport Blast bug? Sometimes allows infinite attacks

- Test in depth Relay Race

- Fix 'avoid' animations

- 'Repeat' bug: sometimes locks the wrong move / allows using blocking
  moves like Love Burst several times in a row

- Implement multiple (simultaneous or consecutive) animations -> Consecutive done

- (Really) Implement Weather

- Nicknames: config option to set default nicks, request nick on login feature 

- Refactor Pony class: separate into Pony (only base stats) and BattlePony (with
  volatiles and stuff you only need during battles)

- Battle timeout

- Fix animations "stand_left" of mane4
