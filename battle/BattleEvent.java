/** The TriggeredEffectDealers handled by the BattleEngine; these Events typically
 * have a duration or a delay after which they disappear, and can be triggered
 * like any TriggeredEffectDealer; the difference with normal TEDs is that a BattleEvent
 * is not linked with a particular pony, but is a 'global' effect, which normally acts
 * independently from its source;
 * BattleEvents can be used in several ways, e.g to spawn a delayed effect
 * or to setup a persistent effect which lasts N turns before disappearing.
