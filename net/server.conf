# Configuration file for the Pokepon Server.
# Entries consist of commands and arguments separated by ":".

# Server name can consist of multiple unquoted words.

# Using the default port is recommended to avoid changing clients'

# Here you can put patterns for forbidden nicknames; patterns are separated 
# by whitespaces
# I put here the string 'null' to avoid confusion in debug messages, 
# but you may remove it: the server is able to handle it.

# If you want to change the database URL, you can do it here. 
# Remember to prepend the URL protocol (currently only working with 
# file:// protocol).

# Connection Policy: paranoid, average, permissive
# - paranoid: disallow all connections except the ones which comply with 
#   our protocol (i.e. responds '!myos <osname>' to the server's first request 
#   ('!youros')
# - average: accept all TCP connections except the ones using HTTP protocol 
#   (useful to prevent browsers to accidentally connect to the server, 
#   which may cause 'ghost sessions' on the server if they don't close 
#   the connection with a proper EOF)
# - permissive: allow all connections

# Default nick to be given to clients on connect. 
# May consist in a string without whitespaces. The resulting nickname _may_ 
# be one of the forbidden server patterns.
# If commented out, the clients will be named after their hostnames 
# (or, if the IP cannot be resolved - which is likely, by their IP). 
# Note that leaving the value uncommented but blank will result in the 
# defaultNick to be the empty string "".

# Message to be sent to clients on connect. Use '\n' or <br> to denote

# Always test you motd when using HTML!
# Examples of tags which are known to cause problems are <table> and <center>
