Poképon
====================================================
Poképon is a multiplayer Pokémon-like battle simulator with ponies.

This branch contains only the server, and it's intended for people who
want to run a dedicated server in batch mode with only the needed
classes. It's recommended, but not required, to run the server in non-JAR mode.

For instructions, see the README on the master branch.
